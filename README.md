Simple travel app that shows a list of top attractions, dining, shopping, and hotels for visitors of city of Mississauga.

*This app is created as the sixth project of [Android Basics Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/android-basics-nanodegree-by-google--nd803) program at Udacity.*

### Features
- Find the top attractions and places to visit in Mississauga.
- Tabbed navigation pattern for quick and easy navigation.
- Design support for both portrait and landscape orientation.

### What I have learned from this project
- Planning an app design and navigation before writing code.
- Selecting proper data structures to store lists of information.
- Implementing tabbed navigation using ViewPager and TabLayout.
- Creating plain object Java object (POJO) class that serve as the data model.
- Using CardView from the design support library to display each list item neatly.
